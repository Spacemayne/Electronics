# Electrical Physics
## Basic Concepts
- **Voltage** is the amount of energy required to move a unit charge from one terminal of a circuit to another.
  - $V=\frac {W}{Q}$
  - where V = voltage
  - W = work done/Total Input energy
  - Q- Charge

- **Potential Difference** is the difference in energy found between the two terminals of a circuit, thereby inducing the tendency of charges to move towards the terminal with lower energy.

- **Current** is the quantity of charge or Energy passing through a junction within a circuit in a give period of time.
  - $I = \frac {Q}{t}$
  - where I = Current
  - Q = Charge
  - t = time period

 - **Resistance** is the opposing force experienced by a charge while travelling through a medium. Formula for Resistance changes based on Circuit arrangement.
 - **Direct Current**(DC) is a form of electrical flow wherein charges travel through a circuit in uniform, singular direction.
 - **Alternating Current**(AC) is a form of electrical flow wherein charges are supplied and travel in oscillating directions through a circuit.
 - **Circuits** in physics can be loosely defined as media through which electricity is passed through, transformed to carry out specific functions and obtain specific values of results of electrical quantities.
   -  A basic circuit consists of a power supply, connecting wires and 'n' number of desired electrical components, varied based on the purpose of the circuit.
 ### Conventional and Electron Flow
 - Commonly within physics, quantities tend towards obtaining lowest possible potential energy; that is, the quantities move from a high potential to low potential.
 - Using this principle, within electrical diagrams, by convention, energy is shown to be travelling from the positive terminal to the negative terminal; this is known as **Conventional Flow**.
 - **Electron Flow** is used to represent the actual flow of charges in the form of electrons, shown by the representation of arrows from the negative to positive terminal.
### Cathodes and Anodes
- Within the chemical process of electrolysis, two charged electrodes, with electricity passing through them are submerged within an electrolyte(Compound that is being broken) and are therefore used, to ionize ions present within the electrolyte, thereby chemical separating the elements present within the Compound used as the electrolyte.
- **Cathode** is described to be the negatively charged electrode within common electrolysis apparatus, through which electrons are directly passed through, attracting the cations within the electrolytes, who use these electrons to return to their elemental electronic configuration.
- **Anode** is described to be the positively charges electrode within common electrolysis approach wherein negatively charged ions are attracted (due to potential difference induced at the anode) and lose electrons to return to their elemental electronic configuration.
 ### Basic Electrical Components
 - A **Battery** may be loosely described as multiple cells connected in series used to supply voltage through a circuit.
 - **Resistors** are defined as devices used within a circuit that are used to change the resistivity/impedance of a circuit.
 - **Capacitors** are devices that use polarization principle to store charges temporarily, after which these charges are released to the rest of the circuit. 
 - **Diodes** can, in general, be defined as devices used to regulate and control the direction of flow of charges within a circuit.
